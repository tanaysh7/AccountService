This is a simple Spring-boot restful web service that connects to Redis (https://redis.io/), which is a fast and scalable in-memory data structure store. Built and runs on Java 8, uses Maven for dependency management and Reddison's Java client to connect to Redis. This service should be able to quickly search , store and retrieve information on the go.
