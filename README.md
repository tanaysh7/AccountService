# AccountService
This is an archetype, I have created for a spring boot restful service that connects to a Redis cache, which is a fast and scalable in-memory data structure store. This service should be able to perform all basic CRUD operations from its rest end points.
I have used Maven for dependency management and Reddison as the java client to access Redis.
